## Introduction

The goal of human detection is to locate every individual in each video image while making the fewest number of false positives. Because it could be used for military, safety, security, and entertainment purposes, the problem of detecting, localizing, and tracking human presence has received a lot of attention. Finding the locations of all instances of humans present in an image is the goal of human detection, which we will complete by examining every area of the image and locating humans in relation to the robotic frame.
